# Building-Damage-Prediction
# Main Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to predict if the structure of a build is subject to damage. This has become necessary due to the impact of environmental and climatic changes on the structure of a building. Conventional methods of building damage estimation require a large amount of time and financial resources. For this reason, in recent years, machine learning algorithms that produce faster and more economical results have become the research topics of interest in damage estimation.
